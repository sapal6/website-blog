    "## What is literate programming\n",

    "Some of you will say this is a programming language, but I ask why it's called a \"language\" ? Well! if you ask me I would say that it's a language and like every other language that exists, it's sole purpose is to enable communication, share stories, share thoughts. Not to a machine but to another human, that's why it's called a programming \"language\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately this programming instructions get's converted into machine code but if this piece of code which when I show to a fellow human then that person would know what instructions I want to give a computer. See! that's communication...that's what languages do.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in short we invented programming languages for communicating our thoughts to another person, our thoughts about what we want a machine to do and that's why we want the programming or coding to be as clear and as human readable as possible."

    "## Literate programming tool \n",
    "To implement a literate programming style you would need special tools. These tools come under the umbrella of literate programming tools, which read through your document, separate out the code and the documentations and put the code in a source code file and the documentation in a text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "While talking about literate programming tools, one can not ignore the role of \"notebooks\" in making it easier for developers to write literate programs. Notebooks are web based interactive computing platforms that let's you write text and code in a web based editor and let's you execute your code interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](notebooks.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Two of the notable notebooks are [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl). Both of these projects differ in their behaviour and the extent of languages they support but both of these projects have a common goal, that is to provide developers with a web based literate programming and exploratory platform. With these projects you can write your documentation and code in the same notebook, interactively execute your code and also share that across as a reproducible environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the very nature of these notebooks projects, they provide a very good foundation of a literate programming environment and using this foundation, [Jeremy howard announced the creation of Nbdev](https://www.fast.ai/2019/12/02/nbdev/). At a very high level Nbdev is a system that let's you write your python code and documentation in jupyter notebook and then generates source code files and the related documentation for your project among other things. However, this is a very lazy explanation of Nbdev. So, I suggest you to read the original launch [blog](https://www.fast.ai/2019/12/02/nbdev/) and the [documentation](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorial.html) to truly appreciate the capabilities of Nbdev.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Nbdev supports the creation of Python projects from a jupyter notebook and it does really superb job at that but there is another popular language ecosystem and notebook environment which the original nbdev doesn't support. That language is [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and the notebook environment is [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl). \n",
    "\n",
    "Pluto is a reactive notebook environment and differs from jupyter notebook environment in many ways. I would suggest you to explore the project [Readme](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) to get an idea about teh awsomeness of Pluto. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pluto is a great exploratory developement platform and really love using it for my Julia project. I love Julia and python equally ðŸ˜‰ and I am big fan of Nbdev (python version) and use it extensively when I am developing projects in python. I always wanted a literate programming tool similar to Nbdev for Pluto/julia and while searching through the Julia forums found this [discussion](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/nbdev-for-julia/32450) -->\n",

    "\n",
    "Scrolling down the discussion thread I could see that lot many folks were also in search of something similar. This is when I decided to do something in this direction and started working on porting Nbdev to Julia. "
